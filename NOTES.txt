I was getting encoding issues. Basically the files were not UTF8 
and my database was only going to accept utf8
so we had to convert the files to utf8 , luckily on my windows computer I have cygwin so I was able to use the command 
iconv -f windows-1252 -t utf-8 place.csv > newplace.csv

The answer to this issue was found here http://superuser.com/questions/27060/batch-convert-files-for-encoding

Batch script to convert a group of csv files to utf
for file in *.csv; do
    iconv -f windows-1252 -t utf-8 "$file" > "$file".tmp
    mv -f "$file".tmp "$file"
done
